      <h1>Maze ball</h1>
      <p>Maze ball is a small test to build a game with procedural maps and a little bit of physics.</p>
      <p>If you visit this on a phone that supports device orientation api, you can use the tilt of your phone to get the ball through the maze into the goal. If you do not have a device ready that supports device orientation, you can use the Arrow Keys to navigate</p>
      <p>There will be a blog entry here, that explains more about how i built this.</p>
      <p><small>PS: If there is no link yet, it means that I havent gotten around to write the post yet</small></p>
      <button type="button">Start game</button>

      <p>Have fun playing it - Tom Heller</p>
